# Status
Work in progress. Layout and structure pretty much complete, however still misses some things from the lecture.

If you spot any mistakes or typos please go ahead and create an issue or a pull request.

# Disclaimer
Please be advised that nothing found here is guaranteed to be complete, correct or anything else. Feel free to report errors, I'll try to fix them.

# Note
This is largely based on the great work by [Gregor Wegberg's](https://github.com/groggi) [CIL Exam 2015 Summary](https://github.com/groggi/eth-cil-exam-summary).
It has simply been adapted to the new lecture content of 2016.
